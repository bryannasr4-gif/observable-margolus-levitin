# Reproducibility — numerics for *A Margolus–Levitin speed limit for observables*

Every quantitative claim in the paper is pinned to a seeded script here. Conventions throughout:
`ℏ = 1`, ground energy `E0 = 0` (so `H ⪰ 0`), spectral spread `σ_A = (λ_max − λ_min)/2`,
`Δ = |⟨A(T)⟩ − ⟨A(0)⟩|`, and the working ratio `r := T(⟨H⟩−E0) σ_A² / Δ²` (the bound is `r ≥ C⋆`).

**The named constant**

    C⋆ = 1/(8K),  K = sup_{x>0}(1−cos x)/x = sin x⋆,  x⋆ = smallest positive root of tan(x/2)=x
    x⋆ = 2.3311223704144226…,  K = 0.7246113537767085…,  C⋆ = 0.1725062674611626…  (pinned to 52 digits)

## Quick start

```bash
python -m pip install numpy scipy mpmath sympy
python -u numerics/make_results.py         # regenerates results.json (constants, no-go, saturation, mixed, structured, battery)
python -u numerics/verify_refinements.py   # trade-off curve, bandwidth-resolved constant, two-observable bound
python -u numerics/make_figures.py         # regenerates paper/figs/*.pdf
```

`results.json` is the consolidated, machine-readable record of the pinned numbers.

## Notes

- `theory_core.py` is the original Stage-1 script and reports the **phase-restricted** constant
  `C_old = 0.18555147…`; the free relative phase lowers it to the sharp `C⋆ = 0.17250627…`
  (see `theory_core_v2.py` for the correction). Both values, and their `7.56%` ratio, are intentional
  and documented — `C_old` is the `β=0` sub-optimum quoted in §V.
- All scripts are self-contained and seeded; expected wall time is seconds to a couple of minutes each
  (`verify_refinements.py` part 3 is the longest at ~a few minutes due to ~4M sampled configurations).
- Random-search "min ratio ≥ C⋆" results are *stress tests*, not proofs; the bound itself is proved
  analytically (see `notes/thm_bound.md`, `notes/thm_constant.md`, `notes/ext_mixed.md`).
